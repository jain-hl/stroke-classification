# Machine Learning Classification Methods for Stroke Prediction

## Introduction

We aim to apply machine learning for predicting strokes amongst patients, given various physical and health descriptors. The importance of building and optimising such a model is derived from the World Health Organisation (WHO), who determine stroke as the 2nd leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 11% of deaths.

Prevention of stroke fatalities is heavily influenced by the early detection and prediction of stroke. Machine learning can prove instrumental in providing medical diagnosis of stroke, by analysing large and complex medical datasets to identify patterns via binary classification models to predict if a patient may suffer from a stroke in the future.

These predictions can be used by healthcare professionals to make more accurate and precise diagnoses, accelerate and reach decisions earlier, thus improving the chance of effective prevention upon diagnosis. Reaching diagnosis earlier for stroke is particularly beneficial since medications can be prescribed to control blood pressure or cholesterol levels, reducing the likelihood of a stroke. Machine Learning can also take a more unbiased approach, reducing human error and external factors potentially resulting from a healthcare facility. It is crucial to assert that machine learning predictions are not intended to be used without professional interpretation and intervention, but rather as an additional factor when handling situations of medical prevention and diagnosis.
